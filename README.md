We want to start a webring of WordPress Women who attend the wpwomen.org Community in D / A / CH. Like it's 1997.

== Description ==

Inspired by the plugin idea from @kay-boy and @nullbytes we decided to create a webring especally for WordPress women. And we choosed the idea of a [Webring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring/ "Wikipedia page for webring") because nobody used it currently and it is the eaiest way to get pages conntected. If you want to join go to the profile page at wpwomende.org and fill out the field "Webring URL" which should be the WordPress blog you are using with the webring plugin. You will then be included in one of the next updates of this plugin. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the content of the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

You will get the webring in the footer of your blog.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
